# Canny Edge Detection in Go

This repo contains the implementation ofthe Canny Edge Detection algo i made while trying to learn how it works along with learning Go.
It is by no means a perfect implementation, but it works and for a first time working in Go, I'd say it's alright.

## How to use
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DFTHLM/go-edge-detection.git
cd go-edge-detection
go run main.go process_image.go path/to/input.jpg path/to/output.jpg
```

## Example
Input:

<img src="https://github.com/DFTHLM/go-edge-detection/blob/main/examples/cathedral_input.jpg"/>

Output:
<img src="https://github.com/DFTHLM/go-edge-detection/blob/main/examples/cathedral_output.jpg"/>
